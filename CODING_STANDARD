The PEP8 coding standard will be followed throughout this project with the following modifications

- 120 length line limit (With wider monitors and higher resolution displays, code flows better at this length IMO)
- function names and local variables use camel case instead of underscores, unless the variable is constant in which
  case all capital letters will be used separated by underscores
- Each module will have a comment at the beginning of the file following this pattern:
    '''
        Module Name

        Module Description

        License Information
    '''
